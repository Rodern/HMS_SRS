        <h3>Software Requirement Specifications</h3>
    </header>
    <main>
        <section>
            <h2>1 Introduction</h2>
            <details>
                <h3>1.1 Purpose</h3>
                <p>Identify the product whose software requirements are specified in this document, including the revision
                    or release
                    number. Describe the scope of the product that is covered by this SRS, particularly if this SRS
                    describes only part
                    of the system or a single subsystem.
                </p>
                <h3>1.2 Document Conventions</h3>
                <p> Describe any standards or typographical conventions that were followed when writing this SRS, such as
                    fonts or
                    highlighting that have special significance. For example, state whether priorities for higher-level
                    requirements are
                    assumed to be inherited by detailed requirements, or whether every requirement statement is to have its
                    own
                    priority.
                </p>
                <h3>1.3 Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions</h3>
                <p>Describe the different types of reader that the document is intended for, such as developers, project
                    managers,
                    marketing staff, users, testers, and documentation writers. Describe what the rest of this SRS contains
                    and how
                    it is organized. Suggest a sequence for reading the document, beginning with the overview sections and
                    proceeding through the sections that are most pertinent to each reader type.</p>
                <h3>1.4 Project Scope</h3>
                <p>Provide a short description of the software being specified and its purpose, including relevant benefits,
                    objectives, and goals. Relate the software to corporate goals or business strategies. If a separate
                    vision
                    and scope document is available, refer to it rather than duplicating its contents here. An SRS that
                    specifies the next release of an evolving product should contain its own scope statement as a subset of
                    the
                    long-term strategic product vision.</p>
                <h3>1.5 References</h3>
                <p>List any other documents or Web addresses to which this SRS refers. These may include user interface
                    style
                    guides, contracts, standards, system requirements specifications, use case documents, or a vision and
                    scope document. Provide enough information so that the reader could access a copy of each reference,
                    including title, author, version number, date, and source or location.</p>
                <h3>1.6 Acronyms and Abbreviations</h3>
                <p>The following acronyms and abbreviation will apply to this document. SRS Software Requirement

            <h2>2 Overall Description</h2>
            <details>
                <h3>2.1 Product Perspective</h3>
                <p>Describe the context and origin of the product being specified in this SRS. For example, state whether
                    this product
                    is
                    a follow-on member of a product family, a replacement for certain existing systems, or a new,
                    self-contained
                    product. If the SRS defines a component of a larger system, relate the requirements of the larger system
                    to the
                    functionality of this software and identify interfaces between the two. A simple diagram that shows the
                    major
                    components of the overall system, subsystem interconnections, and external interfaces can be helpful.
                </p>
                <h3>2.2 Product Features</h3>
                <p>Summarize the major features the product contains or the significant functions that it performs or lets
                    the user
                    perform. Details will be provided in Section 3, so only a high level summary is needed here. Organize
                    the
                    functions to make them understandable to any reader of the SRS. A picture of the major groups of related
                    requirements and how they relate, such as a top level data flow diagram or a class diagram, is often
                    effective.</p>
                <h3>2.3 User Classes and Characteristics</h3>
                <p>Identify the various user classes that you anticipate will use this product. User classes may be
                    differentiated
                    based on frequency of use, subset of product functions used, technical expertise, security or privilege
                    levels, educational level, or experience. Describe the pertinent characteristics of each user class.
                    Certain
                    requirements may pertain only to certain user classes. Distinguish the favored user classes from those
                    who
                    are less important to satisfy.</p>
                <h3>2.4 Operating Environment</h3>
                <p>Describe the environment in which the software will operate, including the hardware platform, operating
                    system and versions, and any other software components or applications with which it must peacefully
                    coexist.</p>
                <h3>2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints</h3>
                <p>Describe any items or issues that will limit the options available to the developers. These might
                    include: corporate or regulatory policies; hardware limitations (timing requirements, memory
                    requirements); interfaces to other applications; specific technologies, tools, and databases to be
                    used; parallel operations; language requirements; communications protocols; security considerations;
                    design conventions or programming standards (for example, if the customer’s organization will be
                    responsible for maintaining the delivered software).</p>
                <h3>2.6 User Documentation</h3>
                <p>List the user documentation components (such as user manuals, on-line help, and tutorials) that
                    will be delivered along with the software. Identify any known user documentation delivery
                    formats or standards.</p>
                <h3>2.7 Assumptions and Dependencies</h3>
                <p>List any assumed factors (as opposed to known facts) that could affect the requirements stated
                    in the SRS. These could include third-party or commercial components that you plan to use,
                    issues around the development or operating environment, or constraints. The project could be
                    affected if these assumptions are incorrect, are not shared, or change. Also identify any
                    dependencies the project has on external factors, such as software components that you
                    intend to reuse from another project, unless they are already documented elsewhere (for
                    example, in the vision and scope document or the project plan).</p>

            <h2>3 System Features</h2>
            <section class="sub">
                <h4></h4>
            </section>
            <section class="sub">
                <h4>Patient Registration</h4>
                <p>An HMS should provide an option to register patients and file all the relevant data
                in the system. This feature is the foundation of a Hospital Management System upon
                which the patient-interaction logic is built. EMRs should contain all the patient’s
                necessary information that will be required for diagnosis and further treatment.
                Apart from medical details, the software should also file financial information like an
                insurance number. All this information should be easily accessible to authorized
                people.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="sub">
                <h4>Booking Appointments</h4>
                <p>An HMS should have the feature to book appointments and change schedules if
                needed. This option should be accessible by both the doctors and the patients to
                book or change an appointment's date and time. The feature should also have an
                integrated notification that generates SMS alerts and emails upon every booking or
                change.
                With such feature doctors and patients can:
                Schedule and manage appointments
                Provide convenient feedback
                Provide the possibility to notify patient upon changing the appointments
                Automate patients’ check-in system</p>
            </section>
            <section class="sub">
                <h4>Billing and Accounting Management</h4>
                <p>Billing and Accounting Management
                An HMS should have a billing system for managing accounts and finances, including
                patients bills, doctor fees, taxes, costs, and revenues of the hospital.
                With details of the treatments and facilities availed by the patient, the software
                should calculate the cost of the procedure. The price chart for the services and
                facilities is predetermined and fed in the system, such as room per day cost,
                operation charges for a particular case, or specific doctor’s fees. With this feature's
                help, a patient can check the final expenses at the time of booking.
                Automation of the account and financial management helps the organization to
                reduce workload and human error. It also helps analyze a medical establishment’s
                financial position and make corrections to its strategy to increase efficiency.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="sub">
                <h4>Doctors Profile Section</h4>
                <p>Ideally, a Hospital Management System should have a separate section with
                information about physicians, such as their services, educational background,
                achievements, and awards. The section should also contain a list of all available
                doctors and their schedules.
                Do remember that people want to know more before they make an appointment, so
                the more information you provide, the more likely people will visit the hospital.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="sub">
                <h4>Laboratory Management</h4>
                <p>The Hospital Management Software should have a feature that quickly retrieves
                and updates the results of laboratory analysis. The software should also notify
                physicians and patients about the lab test results. It should also provide easy access
                to all lab information in one place. Laboratory analysis is vital to the efficiency of
                treatment; the faster doctors can get lab results, the faster can they diagnose the
                disease.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="sub">
                <h4>Inventory Management</h4>
                <p>Hospitals are heavily dependent on medical supplies. A shortage of these supplies
                can cost human life. Hospital Management Software should have proper inventory
                management features to avoid any sudden lack of critical medical supplies. A well
                designed HMS can be an irreplaceable helper in this regard.
                With this feature, the administration can track the supplies and forecast when
                restocking is required. An inventory management feature can also help control when
                drugs approach their expiration dates.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="sub">
                <h4>Statistical Data for Future Forecasting of Hospital Management</h4>
                <p>Statistical reports of finance, patients' and doctors' information, staff performance,
                and inventory can help the institute decide it's strategies better. This feature should
                have the ability to create statistics and reports with just a few mouse clicks.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="sub">
                <h4>Customer Support</h4>
                <p>The Hospital Management System is highly sophisticated, connecting a lot of
                different modules. There is a possibility of software malfunction. Since the entire
                hospital is dependent on the HMS, a support helpdesk is pretty much mandatory.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="sub">
                <h4>Telemedicine solution</h4>
                <p>Telemedicine is an advanced approach in healthcare that allows virtual remote
                meetings with a physician via teleconferencing. The feature is an excellent service
                for patients who cannot make it to the hospital in certain situations. More about it in
                the post A Foolproof Guide To Building Telemedicine Applications.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="sub">
                <h4>Mobile App for Patients and Staff Members</h4>
                <p>Having a mobile app is essential these days. It can help hospital management in
                many ways, such as having personal treatment calendars, details of appointments
                with patients, accessing patient’s information, and lab test analysis. It can also help
                patients book or change a doctor’s appointment, check lab test results, and pay the
                bills.
                A mobile app will also help the hospital personnel to interact with each other more
                conveniently. With a mobile app, doctors can keep close contact with the hospital
                even when staying at home.</p>

                    actions that must be prevented. Refer to any external policies or regulations that state safety
                    issues that affect the product’s design or use. Define any safety certifications that must be
                    satisfied.</p>
                <h3>5.3 Security Requirements</h3>
                <p>Specify any requirements regarding security or privacy issues surrounding use of the product or
                    protection of the data used or created by the product. Define any user identity
                    authentication requirements. Refer to any external policies or regulations containing
                    security issues that affect the product. Define any security or privacy certifications that
                    must be satisfied.</p>
                <h3>5.4 Software Quality Attributes</h3>
                <p>Specify any additional quality characteristics for the product that will be important to
                    either the customers or the developers. Some to consider are: adaptability,
                    availability, correctness, flexibility, interoperability, maintainability, portability,
                    reliability, reusability, robustness, testability, and usability. Write these to be
                    specific, quantitative, and verifiable when possible. At the least, clarify the relative
                    preferences for various attributes, such as ease of use over ease of learning.</p>
